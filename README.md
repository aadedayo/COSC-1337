# COSC-1337
These are some of the java projects i did at UT-Tyler. 
I have either normal comments or Javadoc in most of them, in order to explain how i wrote the program.

  # Project Name - Information about Cars/Airplanes
  * File name - Airplane-1.java
  
  This class was created to encapsulate information about an Airplane, which can be reused in the main class (That is what i like the       most about Java; you can reuse almost everything.)
  * File name - Car-2 (1).java
  
  This class was created to encapsulate information about an Car.
  * File name -Lab7L3 (1).java
  
  This is the main class, where we ran the project. It main fuction is to test the car and airplane class.
  
  # Project Name - Student
  * File name - Student.java
  
  This class was created to encapsulate a student's information.
  * File name - Lab6L1.java
  
  This was the main class, and it basically made use of the student.java class and used loop to process a student data.

  * File name - SalariedEmployee.java
  
  This class was created to encapsulate information for a salaried employee. It also got help from the employee.java class using the concept of inheritance.
  * File name - EmployeeSystem.java
  
  This was the main class, and its job was basically to test/use the other three class.
