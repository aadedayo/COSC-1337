# COSC-1337
These are some of the java projects i did at UT-Tyler. 
I have either normal comments or Javadoc in most of them, in order to explain how i did them.

# Project Name - Information about Cars/Airplanes
  * File name - Airplane-1.java
  
  This class was created to encapsulate information about an Airplane, which can be reused in the main class (That is what i like the       most about Java; you can reuse almost everything.)
  * File name - Car-2 (1).java
  
  This class was created to encapsulate information about an Car.
  * File name -Lab7L3 (1).java
  
  This is the main class, where we ran the project. It main fuction is to test the car and airplane class.
  
# Project Name - Three dimensional shapes
  * File name - Cube.java
  
  This class was created to encapsulate data about a cube.
  * File Name - Sphere.java
  
  This class was created to encapsulate data about a spahere.
